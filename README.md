## Titanic Survival Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes the Titanic disaster dataset to understand the factors influencing passenger survival. The notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and multiple machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.

### Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and insights into the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features and data preprocessing.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**: Training and comparing various machine learning models to predict survival.
- **Visualization**: Detailed plots showcasing the impact of different features on survival rates.

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaiShillo/ML-Flow-Titanic.git
   cd ML-Flow-Titanic
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ML_Flow.ipynb
   ```
